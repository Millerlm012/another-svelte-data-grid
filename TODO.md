# TODO

- Verify that CheckboxCell, TextboxCell, and SelectCell still work after svelte-kit package migration
- Add accessible ways of resizing and reordering columns using only a keyboard
- Add mechanism for loading chunks of data asynchronously so the entire data set does not need to be loaded at once
- Add ability to affix columns and rows so they remain visible when scrolling horizontally or vertically
